/***
 *  The name of runBlocking means that the thread that runs it
 *  (in this case â€” the main thread) gets blocked for the duration of the call,
 *  until all the coroutines inside runBlocking { ... } complete their execution.
 *  You will often see runBlocking used like that at the very top-level of the
 *  application and quite rarely inside the real code,as threads are expensive
 *  resources and blocking them is inefficient and is often not desired.

    launch { // launch a new coroutine and continue
        delay(1000L) // non-blocking delay for 1 second (default time unit is ms)
        println("World!") // print after delay
    }
    println("Hello") // main coroutine continues while a previous one is delayed
}
